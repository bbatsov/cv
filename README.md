# Bozhidar's CV in LaTeX

## Overview

This is my professional CV, typeset neatly in LaTeX, using the
[europecv](http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/help/Catalogue/entries/europecv.html)
class.

Feel free to use it as a template for your own CVs if you like it.

## Usage

You'll need to install TexLive and `europecv`. On Debian/Ubuntu you can do so like this:

``` shell
$ sudo apt install texlive texlive-latex-extra
```

Afterwards you should convert the LaTeX source into pdf:

``` shell
$ pdflatex master.tex
```

That's all!
